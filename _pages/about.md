I am Jagannadh Boddapati. I am currently working as a module development engineer at [Intel mask operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=u3ws0UebnSE&ab_channel=IntelNewsroom) in Santa Clara, CA.

I recently (Aug 2024) finished my Ph.D. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mce.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), accompanied by a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/).
My [thesis](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16636/) was focused on shear-normal coupled deformations in anisotropic structured materials under the supervision of [Prof. Chiara Daraio](http://www.daraio.caltech.edu/).
Prior to joining Caltech, I earned my [Bachelor's](https://sites.google.com/view/jagannadh-kumar/home?authuser=0) with Honors in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Microelectronics from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2018.
My undergraduate research focused on shape-morphing piezo composites, conducted under the guidance of Prof. Ratna Kumar Annabattula.

I possess a well-rounded skill set encompassing hands-on experimental expertise in areas such as additive manufacturing, material testing with computational skills spanning finite element analysis, machine learning, and theoretical knowledge in applied mathematics areas like linear analysis, differential equations. While I am proficient across these domains, my strength lies in leveraging computational tools to tackle complex interdisciplinary fundamental and applied research problems.

I am passionate about understanding the mechanical behavior of a diverse range of materials at various length and time scales. I developed this interest in solid mechanics while finding answers to many questions that occurred to me at various periods of my studies. The exhilarating "aha" moments when I successfully unraveled these inquiries and the delights from comprehending the underlying physics are the key factors that motivate me to delve deeper into this field. In a way, _stress_ serves as my stress-burster.

<!-- My full name is Purna Chandra Jagannadh Kumar, Boddapati. Phonetically, pu:rnʌ tʃ^nðr^ dʒʌgʌnnɑ:ð kuma:r bOudd^pa:ti. Call me _Jagannadh_ or in short _Jag_ as well.
