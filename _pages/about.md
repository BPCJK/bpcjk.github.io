I am someone who thrives on 'stress' and enjoys delving into the intricacies of mechanics of solids. I find immense satisfaction in understanding how stresses play a pivotal role in a diverse range of materials, from metals, living cells non-Newtonian fluids, battery materials to battery materials and beyond across various length scales. Currently I am a PhD candidate in the [Mechanical and Civil Engineering](https://mce.caltech.edu/) department at Caltech. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Chiara Daraio](http://www.daraio.caltech.edu/) and my research is focused on data-driven discovery of structure-property relations in anisotropic metamaterials.

Before coming to Caltech, I received my Bachelor's with Honors in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Microelectronics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. During my undergradate thesis, I worked in the area of shape-morphing piezo composites under the supervison of [Prof. Ratna Kumar Annabattula](https://home.iitm.ac.in/ratna/index.html).

My full name is Purna Chandra Jagannadh Kumar, Boddapati. Phonetically, pu:rnʌ tʃ^nðr^ dʒʌgʌnnɑ:ð kuma:r bOudd^pa:ti. Call me _Jagannadh_ or in short _Jag_ as well.
