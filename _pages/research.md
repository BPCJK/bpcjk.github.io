#### current work

Welcome to my research page! My work focuses on developing and experimentally characterizing anisotropic metamaterials.
Metamaterials derive their special properties from the distinctive deformation, dynamic motion, and elastic energy distribution of their micro- and meso-architectures.
These architected materials can be designed to achieve extreme anisotropy, supporting functionalities like shear-axial coupling, which allows them to deform in unconventional ways.
Such capabilities are crucial for applications in shape-morphing, impact redirection, and elastic wave manipulation, enabling innovative solutions in fields where directional properties and responsiveness are key.
