#### current work

I am currently working on design of architected anisotropic solids and finding design rules for specific material functionalities under linear elasticity. My work is at the intersection of _experimental techniques_ like digital image correlation, tomography, virtual fields methods, 3D printing: _numerical techniques_ like geometry representation, finite elements and data-driven techniques and _theoretical techniques_ like symmetry related point groups.
