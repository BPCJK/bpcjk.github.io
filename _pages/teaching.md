I firmly believe that teaching is a powerful tool for deepening one's comprehension of concepts. During my time at Caltech, I had the privilege of attending lectures delivered by exceptional instructors. Drawing from their teaching methodologies, I have strived to integrate their valuable insights into the classes where I served as a teaching assistant.
