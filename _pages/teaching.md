I firmly believe that teaching is a powerful tool for deepening one's comprehension of concepts. During my time at Caltech, I had the privilege of attending lectures delivered by exceptional instructors. Drawing from their teaching methodologies, I have strived to integrate their valuable insights into the classes where I served as a teaching assistant.

#### ME 12c: mechanics (mechanics of materials)

spring 2019; instructor: Prof. Chiara Daraio

**course Contents:** equilibrium of force systems, principle of virtual work, distributed force systems, friction, static analysis of deformable structures.

**role:** supported the instructor (not as a TA) by creating a variety of in-class demonstration samples such as tabletop photoelasticity.
