Biking is such an entertaining hobby. Biking gives the feels of flying downhill, catching sunsets, a sense of achievement, and a lot of endorphin rush from that sweat! "LA sucks for biking" is a popular statement among many bikers in Los Angeles. Although, itâ€™s not surprising that notorious drivers from parts of the city are not considerate of bikers, you would be surprised to find some amazing and yet safe routes to explore by bike in a city where living without a car is almost impossible.

LA is surprisingly huge and the weather is perfect almost any day of the year. Whether it's a sunset ride or a sunrise ride, or a snow ride, or a cookie ride, you have all of it here. You get the experience of riding through mountains, beaches, tunnels, rivers, lakes, dams, horse trails, golf courses, observatories, luxury homes, ferries, and whatnot, almost everything. If you are in for some great views, here are some popular bike rides in and around Los Angeles that you should check out.

### 1. Rio Hondo Bike Path

Rio Hondo bike path is a one-way 15-mile almost flat bike path starting from Monrovia and ending in Lynwood joining the LA River Bike path in El Monte. The bike path entails a water stream on one side, passes adjacently to San Gabriel Valley airport, golf courses, horseback riding trails, water conservation areas, and many little surprises. While you are riding from South to North, you shouldn't miss a spectacular view of aircrafts landing, flying, taking off, and missing into the gorgeous San Gabriel mountains.

### 2. San Gabriel River Bike Path

Starting at the foothills of San Gabriel Mountains in Azusa, San Gabriel river bike path is yet another almost flat bike path that offers great and smooth riding, especially for beginners. The bike path is almost 40-mile one way and goes all the way to the Seal Beach.

### 3. Pacific Coast Highway between Ventura and Santa Barbara

What about a ride along the coast during sunset? This has to be the best part of riding on the west coast. While LA beaches have well maintained bike paths with paths being constantly cleared off of sand, the part from Ventura to Santa Barbara along PCH is curved in such a way that the sunset time gradually increases from Ventura to Santa Barbara. The advantage is that you can enjoy the sunset for an extended amount of time if you start the ride at Ventura at right time and pace yourself appropriately. Partly into the ride, start looking back and you would see that Ventura's side to be dark while Santa Barbara's side is still bright.
